      <description>Privilege escalation is a common technique used by penetration testers to test unauthorised access to a system. One way to achieve privilege escalation is through service misconfigurations in Windows.
A service is a program that runs in the background on a Windows system, and it can have a variety of functions such as managing network connections, printing, or running scheduled tasks. Services can be configured to run under different user accounts, and some may have higher privileges than others.</description>

When I was looking to better understand privilege escalation, I wanted a lab where I could practice this step alone, without having to go through different steps to gain low privilege user access.</description>
